# hippo-campus-interface
A chat interface to interact with the [hippo-campus memory system](https://github.com/hunter-meloche/hippo-campus) for ChatGPT.
This is not meant to be run standalone without hippo-campus. However, hippo-campus can easily be used by other chat interfaces other than this one. This is just an example implementation.
```shell
python app.py
```
